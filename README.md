Quick-Guide for ZF2 Skeleton Application
------------
In this quick guide, we will place a very humble line chart in the ZF2 Skeleton Application.
**Before starting** make sure you are using a clean [ZF2 Skeleton Application](), and that you already set up **highroller-zf2** using the instructions above.

Open `module/Application/src/Application/Controller/IndexController.php`.

1. Include HighRoller files:
    ```php
    use HighRoller\LineChart;
    use HighRoller\SeriesData;
    ```

2. Inside `indexAction` function create a new line chart:
    ```php
    $linechart = new LineChart();
    $linechart->title->text = 'Line Chart';

    $series = new SeriesData();
    $series->name = 'myData';

    $chartData = array(5324, 7534, 6234, 7234, 8251, 10324);
    foreach ($chartData as $value)
        $series->addData($value);

    $linechart->addSeries($series);
    ```

3. Pass the your HighRoller object `$linechart` to the view:
    ```php
    return new ViewModel(array('highroller' => $linechart));
    ```

Open `module/Application/view/application/index/index.phtml`

1. Include highcharts.js file (you could also do this in your layout):
    ```html
    <script src="http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.highcharts.com/modules/exporting.js"></script>
    ```

2. At the top of the file:
    * Add a HTML div where your chart will be rendered to,
    * Set the div id in the HighRoller object,
    * Finally append the render script.

    ```phtml
    <div id="highroller"></div>
    <?php
        $this->highroller->chart->renderTo = "highroller";
        echo $this->headScript()->appendScript($this->highroller->renderChart());
    ?>
    ```

3. You should now see a beautiful simple line chart in your main page, just like this one:
